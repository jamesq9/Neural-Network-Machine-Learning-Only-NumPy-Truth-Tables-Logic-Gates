# Neural Network + Machine Learning + Only NumPy + Truth Tables Logic Gates
- This project provides the source code to training a neural network using machine learning.
- The project is constrained to use only Numpy and logic for back propagation and Activation layer is implemented within the code
- Neural Network learns the AND, IMPLIES, and XNOR Truth tables.
